## Getting Started
For each model Question Generator, Guesser, Oracle, DM1 and DM2, a separate training script is in
place and can be found at `train<model>.py`.  

If the training is executed for the first time, the
[GuessWhat?! Dataset](https://guesswhat.ai/download) is expected to be found in the directory
specified in the command line arguments (default is `/data`). If the data is not found, it will be
downloaded.

The training files for Question Generator, DM1, DM2, and the inference script, contain code for computing the VGG
fully-connected features on the fly. However, to accelerate training and inference, the visual features have been
cached using `cache_visual_features.py`.
